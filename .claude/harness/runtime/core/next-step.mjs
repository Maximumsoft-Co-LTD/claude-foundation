// One vocabulary for "what moves this change forward".
//
// The status-to-command map lived inline in `changes`, so it was reachable
// only by typing `changes`. Every other place that ends a phase either
// invented its own hint or said nothing, and the SessionStart hook — the one
// moment a fresh context could learn where it stands — said nothing at all.
// A loop that knows its own position but never volunteers it reads, from the
// outside, exactly like a loop that has lost track of itself.
//
// Pure by construction: no filesystem, no process, no change state loaded
// here. Callers pass the status they already hold, which is what lets the
// SessionStart hook share this map without importing the runtime's stores.

// `changes` collapses `proven` into `ready-to-land` or `stale-proof` before it
// gets here, because it has already paid for a workspace hash. Callers that
// have not — the hook, deliberately — see the raw status, so `proven` maps to
// `land check`, which performs that same freshness comparison itself rather
// than guessing at it here.
