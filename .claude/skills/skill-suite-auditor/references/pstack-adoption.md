# pstack adoption map

Reviewed source: Michael Denyer's pstack 0.9.78, commit
[5062f28d9d0cedaed2622a9be82961a7d1df051a](https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude/tree/5062f28d9d0cedaed2622a9be82961a7d1df051a/plugins/pstack/skills).
The original project credits Lauren Tan and Cursor imports; its MIT licenses
and notices remain at that pinned source. This map records ideas reviewed,
not an imported plugin or a promise to retain every upstream instruction.
The Change Loop guidance is independently written for its existing contracts.

## Disposition

All 58 source skills have a destination below. Destinations select the owner of
the idea, not a requirement to invoke every skill or copy its text. Retain
existing Change Loop command names and aliases.

## Adaptation constraints

- Replace poteto-mode's orchestration and setup with existing lifecycle entry
  points, host capabilities, and returned packets. Do not install a second
  SessionStart router or overwrite project model configuration.
- Use design alternatives only for real uncertainty. Design findings go into
  the active OpenSpec design; workers follow harness dispatch, not an arena
  scheduler, private task ledger, or self-created worktrees.
- Code cleanup preserves non-obvious rationale, public contracts, and safety
  checks until evidence supports removal. Comment ambiguity is not deletion
  authority; a file-size threshold is not a correctness failure.
- Historical recall/reporting separates authored, verified, merged, deployed,
  and archived states. Original human decisions outrank agent paraphrases.
  Read only the authorized workspace's history.
- Product repair continues while progress changes; imported retry ceilings do
  not replace the harness's budget or no-progress boundary. Application
  network/job retries still have their own bounded failure contracts.
- Build-produced verification helpers must exercise real surfaces, retain
  evidence after teardown, and pass their own success/failure checks. Providers
  bind proof; a generated skill or reviewer summary cannot write receipts.
- Reviewer independence and diversity come from configured policy, not vote
  counts, model names, or a new reviewer dispatch initiated by a skill.
- Git, PR, tracker messages, deployment, paid execution, and publication keep
  separate authority. Land applies uncommitted diffs and archives through the
  canonical advance route; it preserves repository HEAD and index.

## Verification boundary

Operational procedures supplement the concept map:

- Mechanics, rationale, scoped recall, and fair option comparison:
  [source reconstruction](../../investigate/references/source-reconstruction.md).
- Residue removal that preserves rationale and failure-path guards:
  [cleanup](../../coding-discipline/references/cleanup.md).
- Current-revision CI diagnosis and dependency-ordered review repair:
  [CI and review repair](../../delivery-engineering/references/ci-and-review-repair.md).
- Real-surface driver creation, failure discrimination, and maintenance:
  [verification drivers](../../testing-fundamentals/references/verification-drivers.md).

These procedures are written instructions. Offline helper regressions establish
measurement handling and held-out independence; they do not execute the proposed
model routing cases or establish a model-quality improvement.

Catalog checks establish metadata/reference integrity only. Trigger cases in
`../../skill-evaluation/references/evaluation-cases.json` are proposed behavioral
inputs with expected actions. A static audit does not execute those inputs.
Use actual transcripts and observed artifacts before claiming model behavior
or an improvement in time, tokens, or quality.
