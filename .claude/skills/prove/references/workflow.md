# Prove workflow

Run `claude-foundation advance <change> --through proven`. It establishes fresh
Prove context, reuses valid receipts, executes eligible providers, routes review
before acceptance, and never polls. An automatic in-contract repair returns a
bounded dependency-ordered batch; repair it in Build and resume. There is no
fixed repair-count stop while the progress fingerprint changes. A decision,
authority, resource, conflict, or repeated no-progress boundary preserves state
and returns the responsible actor plus supported alternatives.

`advance` runs agent-runnable reviewers itself; external reviewers return
`WAIT`. A review, dispatch, or `authority run` it names dies with the session:
in a non-interactive run your final reply kills the in-flight dispatch and burns
an infrastructure retry. Never end the reply while a dispatch or background task
is pending. The Bash guard rejects detached `authority run` commands (`&`,
`nohup`, `setsid`, or `disown`); the configured reviewer is synchronous by contract.

Review is fresh independent work: full, then one changed delta. When configured
reviewer infrastructure fails and policy names `main-session`, review the
returned bounded packet in this calling session, fill the pre-attributed
response template, and record it; do not rerun the failed adapter. Final
in-contract findings close only from their current claim/critical-case
receipts—never AI round three or a generic redesign/split/pause question.
All review dispatches share one persisted 30-minute window, including retries,
fallbacks, and delta review; resuming does not reset it. Record an authorized
extension through `change resolve <id> --continue-review --decision-ref <ref>`.
Try in-contract repairs first; if repair cannot progress, explain what was
tried and offer further investigation or Land with the remaining risks.
Use `change waive <id> --capability <capability> --reason <remaining-risk>
--decision-ref <ref>` only after the user's explicit decision, including review.
The waiver binds the current workspace and agreement; it never creates a pass.
Reopen one Decision Sheet only for changed behavior, compatibility, security,
data, or rollout.

`advance` wires a missing or stale adapter itself (`evidence init --write` or
upgrade). Identity may be shared only with committed
`review.independence: "self"`. Codex-only or Claude-Code-only review uses
`review.diversity: "single-model"`; it requires a fresh identity/session.
Never substitute self-review for a required reviewer. A missing capability returns
to Build; a Build-authored checker is eligible only when its own success and
failure paths are covered by the normal test and quality commands.
At review or acceptance the coordinator's advanced bridge is
`authority request`; do not replace that typed handoff with an informal prompt
or a fabricated receipt.
Never expose raw readiness JSON. Keep recovery and resume routes as agent-only
control data unless the user requests diagnosis. Relay every blocker with its
diagnosis, choices, recommendation, and responsible owner.
