description: Create or complete an OpenSpec change and evidence contract.
argument-hint: <intent|existing-change> [--prototype-selection <path>]

Create or update **$ARGUMENTS**. Shared rules: `.claude/harness/AGENT.md`.

1. Read only behavior-settling sources (code, tests, `openspec/specs`); reuse
   settled answers.
2. Write the draft with the Write tool, not shell, to `.foundation/drafts/<id>.json` (no
   `version`): `intent`,
   `requirements[{description with SHALL, scenarios[{when, then}]}]`,
   `tasks[{outcome, verify, paths}]`; `verify`: an existing test command
   failing on wrong behavior. Write prose in the requested document
   language, else the request's.
3. Run `claude-foundation change start .foundation/drafts/<id>.json`. If the
   request approved the spec, add `--approve-spec --decision-ref <ref>` (`/dev` adds its
   `--through`): one call starts, approves, continues.
   - `EDIT`: fix every named field via Edit, rerun.
   - `ASK_USER`: ask, record answers in the draft, rerun.
   - `DONE`: packet files and tasks print; do not reopen them.

Read `.claude/skills/change/references/workflow.md` completely only for a
draft declaring `impact` medium/high, `riskSignals`, `integrations`, external
operations, several repositories; lane `standard`; or a revision or
amendment (a keyword like billing only adds review). It owns
agreement-detail and document-language rules. Read sibling
`semantic-intake.md` for discovery rows or `ASK_USER` frontiers.

Never abandon a change: `change revise <id> <draft>` before
Build, `change amend <id> <amendment>` after; handle each as in step 3. No
product code during Change.

## Gate: spec approval

Unless approved, link the packet; explain scope, behavior, acceptance criteria,
and open questions in ordinary words; validation is not approval. Record
it with `claude-foundation advance <id> --approve-spec --decision-ref <ref>`
or step 3's flags. Change stops here.

Report product changes in the user's language; hide commands/jargon.
